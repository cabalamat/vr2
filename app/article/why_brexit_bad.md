#  Why Brexit Is Bad

This article details some of the reasons why Brexit is bad for Britain.
It won't detail all of them, because if it did it would be 10 or 100 times longer!

There are, broadly, three options Britain can choose about Brexit:

* Remain in the European Union
* leave the European Union, but continue close economic links with it ("Soft Brexit")
* leave the European Union, and no longer have close economic links with it ("Hard Brexit")

There are degrees of hardness for different forms of Brexit. The closer the economic links with the
EU, the softer the Brexit.

## Hard Brexit is Bad

A **Hard Brexit** would be bad because the UK economy is strongly tied in with the rest of the European economy.
If we have significant tariff and non-tariff barriers between the UK and the EU, it will it will make trade
between the two harder. For example, this will hit the motor industry, which is heavily integrated with Europe. 

It's possible in time that these problems can be resolved. Brexiteer Jacob Ress-Mogg thinks it might take 50
years before we see the benefits of Brexit. But in the short to medium term, Britain will suffer.

## Soft Brexit is Bad

A **Soft Brexit** is one where the UK continue to have close ties with the EU. This means that the
UK might continue to be in the Customs Union or the Single Market, or both.

A soft Brexit would not have anywhere near as big an immediate economic impact on the UK as a hard Brexit would.
But it would mean we would have to continue to to obey the EU's rules, but would no longer have any say in how they are made.
We would become a "rule taker" as the jargon goes.

The EU's rules are always changing, so in the long term they would change towards the interests of the EU's members, 
and against Britain's interests. We would find ourselves bound by rules which slowly, imperceptibly, make us worse off.

Some people have proposed a soft Brexit as a "compromise" between hard Brexit and remaining in the EU. The problem with
this compromise is we fall between two stools, getting both the disadvantages of a hard Brexit (harm the economy) and
the disadvantages of remaining (loss of national autonomy), while gaining little.

## Why Brexit hasn't Happened

The UK government under Theresa May has tried to deliver Brexit but they have failed.

There is no majority for May's Withdrawal Agreement. MPs voted on a series of *indicative votes* in March 2019
to see if there was anything they could agree on, but none of the options was able to get a majority.

Why was this? It's because all the options are bad, in some way or other:

* Hard Brexit: bad because it seriously harms the economy
* Soft Brexit: bad because it makes us a rule-taker
* Remain in EU: bad because it doesn't respect the referendum result

So the essential reason why Brexit hasn't happened yet is that **all forms of Brexit are a bad idea**.
