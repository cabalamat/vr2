# Vote Remain to Stop Brexit

So, if [Brexit is bad](why_brexit_bad), how can we stop it?

The final decision on what happens with Brexit will be made by MPs. 

So how can ordinary citizens affect the result?
One thing that MPs care about is election results. Politicians of all parties want to
get re-elected, and all parties want to win elections, so they all care about and pay attention to election results.

So if lots of voters vote remain, politicians will notice, and will act accordingly.

The more of use who vote remain, the bigger the effect will be. Will it be big enough to stop Brexit?
It's impossible to tell, since no-one knows what will happen with Brexit. But the more people who
vote remain, the less likely Brexit becomes.
