# Why Vote Remain?

The whole point of this website is to persuade you to vote for a remain party
in the European election on Thursday 23rd May.

## Vote for a Remain party

You’ll notice that here I’m saying “a Remain party” and not saying which one. There are lots of parties that support remain. Ones that stood in the 2014 European election include the Lib Dems, the Greens, the SNP, and Plaid Cymru. New Remain parties that have said they will stand include Change UK (formerly The Independent Group), and Renew. It may be that they will fight separate campaigns, or it may be that some or all of them will fight on a joint “United Against Brexit” banner. I don’t know which will happen. Nor am I saying which remain party you should vote for. Remainers have a wide spectrum of political beliefs on issues other than Brexit. What I am asking you to do is to a vote for a Remain party — any Remain party. You might choose to vote for the one you like best, or you might vote for the one that looks set to do the best in your region, based on opinion polls. It’s your choice. But vote for a Remain party on 23rd May.

* If Remain parties do well, that makes Brexit less likely.
* If a Remain party tops the polls, that makes Brexit less likely.
* If Remain parties, between them, get over half the vote, that makes
  Brexit very much less likely. That’s our big prize and we can win it!

Brexiteers used the result of the 2017 general election to argue that “most people voted for Brexit parties, so most people support brexit”. We mustn’t allow them to make that argument again.

## How well might we do?

How well might we do? I think we might do very well. As I’ve already said, 6 million petitioners asked to revoke Article 50 and cancel Brexit, and more people vote in elections than sign petitions. Furthermore, European elections traditionally have a low turnout: in 2014 only 36% of the electorate bothered to vote.

Before 2016 most pro-Europe people weren’t particularly enthusiastic or fervent in their support for the EU; they took Europe for granted. Brexiters, on the other hand, were enthusiastic. But now the situation is different: people value something more when they risk losing it, and we certainly risk losing the EU now! Remainers do seem to be more active and enthusiastic now than leavers: the 6 million for the Revoke Article 50 petition is ten times bigger than the biggest leave petition. And the estimated one million who marched through London earlier this year for a People’s Vote is vastly larger than any pro-Brexit march.

A combination of traditional low turnout in the European elections, highly motivated remainers and less-motivated leavers: these are just the right ingredients needed for remain to do well.
