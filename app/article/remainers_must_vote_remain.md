# Remainers Must Vote Remain

Do you want to remain in the European Union? If so, this article explains why you must vote for a remain party in the European elections on 23 May.

All politicians care about election results. Politicians want to get re-elected, and political parties want to win elections.
Ordinary voters don't have much leverage over politicians, in fact choosing which of them to vote for is pretty much all the 
leverage we have; so we have to use it. 
They will notice if remain does well, and act accordingly.

What does it mean for remain to do well. A number of things:

* a high %age of the vote goes to remain parties
* if over half the votes got to remain parties
* if lots of seats got to remain parties
* if remain parties win most of the seats
* if the largest party, by seats won, is a remain party 

Whether we leave the EU or remain in it is determined not by MEPs but by MPs in Westminster.
